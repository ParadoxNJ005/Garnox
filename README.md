# Sembreaker ðŸ“š

Hola Friends, itâ€™s a common scene on the night before the examinations, we the students knock at each of our topperâ€™s door to get his/her notes and waste a lot of our precious time in doing that. What if there is a central place where you would get all the magical notes and material to pass the papers, the destination is here, the SemBreaker App. Sounds fun Right ?
